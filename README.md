This is a collection of C programs considered important for C related exams or campus interviews.
An interesting fact about this repo is that I removed all code I had written by mistake through terminal, and I am going into a speed
coding mode to write those 12 porgrams lost. Will update the time taken to write those after I finish. I'm starting at 8:10 PM IST.
